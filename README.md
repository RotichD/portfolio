# Developer Portfolio
## Description
I built this single page portfolio to demonstrate my technical skills to potential employers as well as showcase my projects. With the project I challenged myself to learn Material UI, React-Router, and StyledComponents, all three of which I had no prior experience with.

## Installation
This website is already live on Github Pages @[Dylan Rotich Developer Portfolio](https://rotichd.github.io/portfolio_v4/). Please note that the # symbols in the url are required due to GH Pages not working well with BrowserRouter. I am using HashRouter as a work around.
## Usage
Functions as a normal website. Project cards have links to both repositories and live sites. Clicking a project picture will also open that project's live website in a different page. Smooth scrolling with nav links. Nav collapses on mobile.
